## Developer Comment

Hello everyone, and welcome back to my Repo! My name is Abdulhakeem Dahir and I am an aspiring Software Developer. This week I have been tasked to update our Online Portfolio. Even though my current one is heavy html and bootstrap focused, I'm excited to eventually incorporate Javascript and React in the future! Any feedback is welcome! Thank you!

## Application Summary

An Employer is looking to hire a Web Developer for a Full Time or Part Time role. They are seeking someone who can showcase their talent and skillset by having a Live and Deployed Portfolio. The Portfolio itself must be responsive, and it must showcase all of the work that the applicant has done.

### User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Website Features and Highlights

The follwing are all of the feautres and highlights of my portfolio:

### HTML

```
- Used semantic Html for my website structure
- Sectioned areas so as to layout more easily
- Created both an Aside and Container class for easier flex layout.
- Validated my code with w3 validator.
```

### BootStrap

```
- Used Bootstrap variables for more robust styling
- Used Flexbox for a responsive layout
```

### Images

```
- Used free images from iconfinder
- Optimized all images for load-times.
```
